# MS-Vulnerable-Driver-List
This tool is for machines that do not support Microsoft's vulnerable driver blocklist (eg. Windows 7,8).  
The resulting SHA256 hash list can be loaded into many EDR products for detection and/or blocking.

The vulnerable driver blocklist can be downloaded from (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules#vulnerable-driver-blocklist-xml)
